Step 1: Pain Point
------------------
1. The point of this project is to complete a coding challenge for an internship position. 
They are asking for a google calendar like app where you can add edit or delete events. 
Required - 
display weekly view, start with current week
highlight current date (today)
allow navigating to previous and next week
add, edit, delete events
To keep task simple -  
events don't overlap, can reject event if it overlaps with existing one
events don't need to expand through multiple days
events may have fixed durations (1 hr slots)
Bonus - 
good UI/UX
presists the data (doesn't get lost on reload)
has a backend (uses APIs to load and save events)
*additional credits if backend is in cloud infrastructure (AWS or Google Cloud)

Step 2: Plan the features
-------------------------
1. SPA
- calendar is main view
- add or edit event dynamically
- new get request when getting previous or next week
- can create events with fixed slots only

2. possible modifications
- confirm deletion 
- have multiple views (day or week)
- add time zone

Step 3: Build Sub-Components
----------------------------
- Each event has:
    title
    date
    time
    description
    location
